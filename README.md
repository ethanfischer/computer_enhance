C# Sim86 homework for Casey Muratori's Performance Aware Programming course

It's not pretty, and does the bare minimum (no challenge homework), but it works

The program's entry point is in sim86_test.cs. It's currently set to run against the last homework listing (56 - estimating cycles). That can be modified in the first line of Main()

As of this writing, this passes homework listings 37-56
